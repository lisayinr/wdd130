        <p>My name is Lisa, and I am a sophmore at Brigham Young University - Idaho studying computer science.</p> 
        <p>I enjoy going on hikes and watching movies, and I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</p>
        <p>all my life. I think learning how to create a website can be very beneficial especially for people who own businesses.</p>
        <p>I hope that at the end of this course I will be able to create a clean and functioning website and use this knowledge</p>
        <p>to create a website for my family's business.</p>
